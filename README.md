ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm [Isaac Katongole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katongole-isaac-7a22aa178 "linkedIn") a passionate and result-driven frontend developer with expertise in Reactjs, Nextjs for 4 years and I love working on projects from scratch. 

So far, with 4 years of experience, I have managed to improve on my coding skills from the way i structure the projects, using version controls like git to manage code branches, integrating third party services, deploying on hosting platform, working with databases, dockerizing application.

I have worked with a few teams (both local and remote) as frontend developer mainly using reactjs for building user interfaces for websites and web apps. 

The side-hustles I do here force me to work on both frontend and backend to survive otherwise I would end up with nothing. For the backend, I use [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org "Nodejs") my favorite.

Please don't hesitate to reach out, I may be the missing part in your software developer team. I'm available to work with any team across world.
