## Frontend developer

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Isaac, a dedicated frontend web developer with 4 years of experience building scalable, fully functional web applications for local and remote clients. I specialize in creating intuitive user interfaces using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I also have hands-on experience deploying web apps on cloud platforms like AWS, Vercel, Netlify, and GCP.

On top of that, I also skilled in developing fast, scalable, and secure backend systems with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

I spend my time honing problem-solving skills by practicing algorithms and tackling challenges on LeetCode.
